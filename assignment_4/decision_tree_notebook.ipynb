    "# CS 6601 Assignment 4: Decision Tree Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning offers a number of methods for classifying data into discrete categories, such as k-means clustering. Decision trees provide a structure for such categorization, based on a series of decisions that led to separate distinct outcomes. In this assignment, you will work with decision trees to perform binary classification according to some decision boundary.  Your challenge is to build and to train decision trees capable of solving useful classification problems. You will learn first how to build decision trees, then how to effectively train them and finally how to test their performance.\n",

If multiple tests have the same number of attributes and classify the same number of examples, then break the tie using attributes with lower index numbers (e.g. select $A_1$ over $A_2$)\n",
